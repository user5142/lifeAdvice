# lifeAdvice

lifeAdvice is a program I wrote as part of Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer Path. 

The goal of the project was to create a program that generates random messages each time it is run. 

The program consists of four parts:
- a random number generating function
- a nested array of adlibs
- a for loop
- a formatting function

The random number generating function generates a random number based on the length of the nested adlib arrays. The for loop iterates over the adlib arrays and chooses a random adlib within the array via the random number function, then concatenates the random adlib with a predetermined prompt and pushes the full statement into a new array. The three statements in the new array are then formatted and printed to the console.
